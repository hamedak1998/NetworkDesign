## NetworkDesign.jpg

This is a basic **star topology network diagram** created in Lucidchart. It includes:
- 2 computers
- 1 router
- 1 shared printer

I chose a **star topology** because it's a simple and scalable structure commonly used in home and small office networks. All devices are connected through a central router, making communication and maintenance easier.
